I think we can all agree hops have risen in popularity, at least across the entire West Coast. I just drove up to Seattle from LA and stopped by a few breweries along the way. Literally every brewery had at least 2-3 IPAs and I was surprised to find double IPAs at each of the establishments from small local breweries to inter-state mega breweries.

Humulus lupulus is a pretty swag name by the way; its a cool plant nonetheless. Hops are supported by bines vs. vines for grapes. This refers to how the plant supports its weight by forming a helix around a support (vs tendrils/twining around a host).
