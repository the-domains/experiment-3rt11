I think we can all agree hops have risen in popularity, at least across the entire West Coast. I just drove up to Seattle from LA and stopped by a few breweries along the way. Literally every brewery had at least 2-3 IPAs and I was surprised to find double IPAs at each of the establishments from small local breweries to inter-state mega breweries.

## Some of my favorite hops

I have listed below some hops that I like to use for **1\. Bittering hops**,**2**. **Dual Purpose Hops**, and **3\. Aroma Hops**.

1\. Bittering hops go inat the beginning of the boil and add to the bitterness of a beer mainly because these hops stay in the boil longer. Simply put, the hops add more to the bitterness the longer these little guys stay in the boil while adding more to the aroma as they are added towards the end of the boil (60-90 minute boils for most beers) or after the boil in the fermenter during the fermentation process of 2-3 weeks (dry hopping).

2.Dual purpose hops are put into the boil halfway through to near the end of the boil. I generally like my beers to have more dual purpose and aroma hops than bittering hops because I like to have the subtleties of the hops come out more.

3\. Aroma hops is where its at for IPAs. An IPA with big smells is pretty dank. I put most of my hops in the aroma stage of hop droppin, near the end of the boil, at flame-out, and during dry-hopping which we will get to late. Mosaic seems to be rising in popularity and Amarillo as of late has become one of the most sought. Simcoe and Amarillo are in many of my favorite beers such as Duet by Alpine and Pliny the Elder by Russian River.

Dry hopping was not a common practice in brew baby making until recently. The craze over fresh hoppy beers is in and its here to stay. I'm just wondering if people ever vape this stuff to get their daily alpha and beta acid nutrients in.
