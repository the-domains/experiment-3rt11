What is the future for VIX futures? Is complacency at an all-time high?

I have been following the TVIX (Velocity Shares 2x VXX) for some time now. My initial success with the TVIX was when I bought shares prior to the Brexit vote. It was a clear gamble but I simply rationalized that a major vote with major implications if passed with a 50/50 chance should have a clear impact on market volatility.

I have lost money in the last week on the TVIX but I will be holding it expecting the bears to come out pulling apart this much hated S&P bull run. Furthermore, it would be safe to assume that come election day November 8th there will be a big spike in the TVIX. Either a Trump or Clinton victory with have dramatic changes to the economy but markets suggest a Clinton victory (correlation between S&P rise and incumbent party winning election).
