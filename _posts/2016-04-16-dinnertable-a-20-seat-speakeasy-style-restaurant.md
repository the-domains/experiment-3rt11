What is the future for VIX? Is complacency at an all-time high and we are just waiting for a peak so it can all crash down again?

I have been following the TVIX (Velocity Shares 2x VXX) for some time now. My initial success with the TVIX was when I bought shares prior to the Brexit vote. It was a clear gamble but I simply rationalized that a major vote with major implications if passed with a 50/50 chance should have a clear impact on market volatility.

I have lost money in the last week on the TVIX but I will be holding it expecting the bears to come out pulling apart this much hated S&P bull run. Furthermore, it would be safe to assume that come election day November 8th there will be a big spike in the TVIX. Either a Trump or Clinton victory with have dramatic changes to the economy but markets suggest a Clinton victory (correlation between S&P rise and incumbent party winning election).

An article from WSJ from 8-10-2016 points out whistleblowers can get paid 10-30% of payouts from the SEC for snitching such as 2 former State Street employees who combined will get a payout of $90 million, about $45 million each. I wonder what sort of payouts will happen after the next financial crisis, risky behavior only gets punished when it starts to lose a lot of money such as a financial scare.

To be honest, I think the banks, at least the top 5 US banks, have much better balance sheets now but slower growth to earnings than before 2008-2009\. They have more money set aside for bad oil loans, higher capital reserve requirements with the Dodd-Frank bill, lower consumer credit card debt than before the last crisis, a healthy real-estate market.
